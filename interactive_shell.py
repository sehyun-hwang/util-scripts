def open_shell(connection, remote_name='SSH server'):
    """
    Opens a PTY on a remote server, and allows interactive commands to be run.
    Reassigns stdin to the PTY so that it functions like a full shell, as would
    be given by the OpenSSH client.

    Differences between the behavior of OpenSSH and the existing Paramiko
    connection can cause mysterious errors, especially with respect to
    authentication. By keeping the entire SSH2 connection within Paramiko, such
    inconsistencies are eliminated.

    Args:
        @connection
        A live paramiko SSH connection to the remote host.

    KWArgs:
        @remote_name="SSH server"
        The name to use to refer to the remote host during the connection
        closed message. Typically a valid FQDN or IP addr.
